## 🇪🇸 Todo es un objeto, 🇺🇸 Everything is an object

One of the most basic ideas is that you are going to be working with objects. Data, plots, and analysis results are all objects that you can interact with. You can save, copy, and manipulate them.

## Plotting is like baking a layered cake

Creating figures using `ggplot()` requires at least three basic layers. Once you understand these layers, you can build incredible figures adding extra layers. 

## Cleaning data is like a river that flows down the mountain

Cleaning data in the {tidyverse} involves creating sequences of actions that, together, create a new object (your clean data).
